# iplproject
#I have made this project using Tailwind CSS as it is comparatively easier than normal CSS ,i have also used the grid property which allows us to call n no of divs in a single row ,and hence copy pasted 1st row and made other two rows similarly.
#With this project i got a basic undestanding of Tailwind CSS and got to know how powerful it is because of various utility classes presennt ..as compared to CSS.
